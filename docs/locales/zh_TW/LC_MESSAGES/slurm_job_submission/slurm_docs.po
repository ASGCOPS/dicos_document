"A job submission file can contain any of the commands that you would "
"otherwise issue yourself from the command line. It is, for example "
"possible to both compile and run a program and also to set any necessary "
"environment values (though remember that SLURM exports the environment "
"variables in your shell per default, so you can also just set them all "
"there before submitting the job). The results from compiling or running "
"your programs can generally be seen after the job has completed, though "
"as SLURM will write to the output file during the run, some results will "
"be available quicker."
